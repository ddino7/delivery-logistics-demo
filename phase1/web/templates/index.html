    <h2>System Architecture</h2>
    <ul class="architecture-list">
    <li>
        <strong>Phase 1 – Shipment Management:</strong>
        Creation of shipments with sender/receiver details, weight, addresses and product lists.
        Supports shipment status updates (created, in warehouse, in delivery, delivered) and
        tracking by tracking number. Built on a load-balanced web layer with a document-oriented
        database using replication for reliable and scalable storage of shipments, suppliers and products.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Phase 2 – Logistics Network:</strong>
        Visualization of distribution centers and warehouses with optimal route calculation
        between locations. Introduces a graph database to model logistics infrastructure as nodes
        and routes as relationships with distance, time and cost attributes, enabling efficient
        network analysis.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Phase 3 – Real-Time Tracking & Analytics:</strong>
        Real-time GPS event streaming from delivery vehicles, allowing live vehicle tracking.
        Advanced shipment search by tracking number, status and recipient.
        Includes event streaming, centralized logging, indexing and search,
        and dashboards for key metrics such as shipment status distribution,
        average delivery time and delays.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Phase 4 – Predictive Delivery (Optional):</strong>
        Estimation of delivery times based on historical shipment data,
        route distances and real-time GPS information.
        Integrates batch data processing and a model serving system
        to support machine learning–based predictions.
    </li>
